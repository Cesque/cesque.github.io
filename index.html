        Hi, I'm
        <strong>Daniel James</strong>

      <div class="box box-left">
        I'm a recent
        <strong>Computer Science</strong> graduate from the
        <strong>University of Birmingham</strong>, now looking for a job in front-end development. I'm passionate about creativity
        and technology, as well as finding interesting and innovative ways to combine them.

        I have experience with the big web technologies -
        <strong>HTML</strong>,
        <strong>CSS</strong> and
        <strong>Javascript</strong>. In particular, my passions include learning about new and cutting edge technologies, as well as learning
        new frameworks and libraries. For example, I wrote a
        <a href="https://github.com/Cesque/ztimer-remake">Rubik's Cube solve timer</a> using
        <strong>vue.js</strong> supported by features such as
        <strong>CSS grid</strong> and
        <strong>ES6 module support</strong>.

    <div class="section section-left pattern memphis green">
      <div class="box box-left">
        I also program in
        <strong>Node.js</strong>, creating server-side applications and other projects. For example, the cube timer also contains
        an API which supplies random intial states for Rubik's Cubes.

      <div class="box box-right">
        Another project I completed is
        <a href="https://github.com/Cesque/qcpu">qcpu</a>, a fictional CPU implementation written in Node.js, with an included assembler from a specially created
        assembly language. Using
        <strong>Browserify</strong> I used the CPU emulator module in a web interface which lets users write and execute their own
        assembly code for the CPU.

    <div class="section section-left pattern scroll-left hypno orange">
      <div class="box box-left">
        I can also program in <strong>C#</strong>: for example, my university dissertation,
        <a href="https://github.com/Cesque/yod">Creating a library to aid in constructed language generation</a>, focused on a <strong>library written in C#</strong> which
        procedurally-generated artificial languages for use in creative media such as books and films. The library is accompanied by a
        command-line application which provides a front-end interface with which users can interact with the library and create their own
        languages.

    <div class="section section-right pattern china turquoise">
      <div class="box box-right">
        Aside from those languages, I also have some experience with <strong>Java</strong>, and a little experience with Haskell, OCaml, C and C++. Most recently,
        I have been spending some of my free time learning the systems programming language <strong>Rust</strong>.

    <div class="section section-left pattern scroll-right memphis yellow">
      <div class="box box-left">
        I don't just write code, though! I also <strong>compose music</strong>: I recently wrote the soundtrack for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/desert-of-vice/id1272238004">Desert of Vice</a>,
        an iOS and Android adventure mystery game which was featured on the iOS App Store, as well as creating sound effects. Some more of my compositions can be found
        on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/cesque">SoundCloud</a>.

    <div class="section section-right pattern scroll-left topo magenta">
      <div class="box box-right">
        As well as music for games, I also <strong>write electronic music</strong> under the name <em>Cesque</em> - my latest releases can be listened to on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/7t0L8hVXCaAbv5AiCoCrD5?si=2MdHC19CTOGythZndPwBdA">Spotify</a>.

        My other interests include playing piano, video games, solving Rubik's cubes, and learning about linguistics and language in general.
